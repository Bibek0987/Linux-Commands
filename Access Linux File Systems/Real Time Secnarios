1: A new disk is attached — You must partition, format, and mount it
Commands:
lsblk
fdisk /dev/sdc   # create /dev/sdc1
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1
mkdir /appdata
mount /dev/sdc1 /appdata
echo "/dev/sdc1 /appdata xfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

Why this is real?

This happens during adding storage for applications, logs, backup, database, or Docker/OCP storage.

🟦 SCENARIO 2: Developer complains “disk is full”
Check disks:
df -h
du -sh /var/log/*

Found /data disk is not mounted (mount failed after reboot)
Fix:
mount -a


If error → check fstab syntax.

🟨 SCENARIO 3: NFS Share needs to be mounted for application
Test NFS:
showmount -e 10.0.0.20

Mount:
mount -t nfs 10.0.0.20:/sapdata /mnt/sap

Permanent:
10.0.0.20:/sapdata  /mnt/sap  nfs  defaults  0 0

🟥 SCENARIO 4: "device is busy" when trying to unmount
Issue:
umount /data
umount: /data: target is busy.

Solution: find who is using it
lsof | grep /data
fuser -m /data


Kill processes:

fuser -km /data
umount /data

🟧 SCENARIO 5: ISO file needs to be mounted
mount -o loop RHEL9.iso /mnt/iso


Unmount:

umount /mnt/iso

----------------------------
🔧 4. COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
----------------------------
❌ Error: "mount: wrong fs type"

Fix:

blkid /dev/sdb1
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1

❌ Error: "mount: special device does not exist"

Fix:

lsblk
fdisk -l
udevadm settle

❌ Error: machine stuck during boot because fstab entry is wrong

Fix by editing fstab in rescue mode:

mount -o remount,rw /
vim /etc/fstab


Add noauto temporarily or comment the broken line.

❌ Error: "target is busy"

Fix:

lsof /data
fuser -km /data
umount /data

🧠 5. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (with Answers)
----------------------------
1. What is mounting in Linux?

Mounting means attaching a filesystem to a directory so the OS can access it.

2. What file is used for permanent mounting?
/etc/fstab

3. How to check which process is preventing unmount?
fuser -m /mountpoint
lsof /mountpoint

4. Difference between mount and unmount?

mount → add filesystem

umount → remove filesystem

5. How to mount ISO?
mount -o loop file.iso /mnt

6. What happens if fstab has a wrong entry?

The system may not boot.

7. How to mount NFS?
mount -t nfs server:/path /mnt

8. How to remount root filesystem read-write?
mount -o remount,rw /

----------------------------
🏢 6. REAL COMPANY SCENARIOS (Very Common)
----------------------------
⭐ Scenario A — Application server needs a separate /app mount

Company wants separate storage for application logs.

Solution:
fdisk /dev/sdb
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
mkdir /app
mount /dev/sdb1 /app
echo "/dev/sdb1 /app xfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

⭐ Scenario B — Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) needs separate storage

DB team asks for separate mount for /var/lib/mysql.

Steps:

Stop DB

Mount new disk

Copy old data

Update fstab

⭐ Scenario C — Kubernetes/OpenShift storage

Storage team provides new disk for container logs.

Mount under:

/var/lib/containers
/var/lib/kubelet


Requires:

mount /dev/sdc1 /var/lib/containers

⭐ Scenario D — Programmer accidentally deleted fstab entry

System fails to mount important disk → website down.

Fix:

mount -a
vim /etc/fstab

⭐ Scenario E — Backup team wants NFS mount

Mount backup storage:

mount -t nfs backupserver:/archive /mnt/backup


Add in fstab:

backupserver:/archive /mnt/backup  nfs  defaults 0 0

Real-Time Enterprise Scenarios (VERY IMPORTANT)
Scenario 1: Application not starting because config file is missing

Developer says:

“My app cannot find config.yml”

You run:

find / -name config.yml 2>/dev/null


You discover it is under /opt/app/conf/config.yml.
You update the service file:

Environment="CONFIG_PATH=/opt/app/conf/config.yml"
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart myapp

Scenario 2: Server disk full; find largest files
find / -type f -size +500M -exec ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null


or easier:

du -sh /* | sort -h


You find /var/log/messages is 8GB → rotate logs:

logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

Scenario 3: Find world-writable files (Security Audit)

Security team asks:

find / -perm -002 -type f 2>/dev/null


Fix:

chmod o-w <file>

Scenario 4: Identify files changed in the last 10 minutes

Useful for debugging unauthorized change.

find / -mmin -10 2>/dev/null

Scenario 5: Find all files created by a terminated employee
find /home -user john


Then archive or transfer:

tar -czf john_backup.tar.gz /home/john

🔴 3. Common Issues + Solutions
❌ Issue 1: locate gives no result
locate nginx.conf


No output.

✔ Fix: update the database

sudo updatedb

❌ Issue 2: find shows many permission denied errors
find / -name test


✔ Fix:

find / -name test 2>/dev/null


or run as root.

❌ Issue 3: find command is slow

✔ Use specific paths:

❌ BAD:

find / -name server.crt


✔ GOOD:

find /etc -name server.crt

❌ Issue 4: Find symbolic link target
readlink -f /usr/bin/python

❌ Issue 5: Cannot find where a package installed files**

Example:

rpm -ql httpd

🔴 4. Interview Questions & Answers (Very Common)
Q1: Difference between find and locate?

Answer:

find searches the filesystem in real time → slower, always accurate

locate uses a prebuilt database → very fast but may be outdated

Q2: How to find files modified in last 24 hours?
find / -mtime -1

Q3: How to find & delete .log files bigger than 100MB?
find /var/log -name "*.log" -size +100M -delete

Q4: How to find all files owned by a specific user?
find / -user username

Q5: What is the difference between whereis and which?

which → executable path in $PATH

whereis → binary + source + man-page locations

Q6: A developer says “my script is using wrong python version.” What do you check?
which python
type python

🔴 5. Real Company Use Cases (asked in RHCSA job roles)
Use Case 1: Security Audit

Security team asks:

“Find all SUID and SGID files.”

Command:

find / -perm /6000 -type f 2>/dev/null

Use Case 2: Identify When a Server Was Compromised

Search for newly created files:

find / -mmin -60 -type f

Use Case 3: Developer Lost the Location of a Script
find / -name deploy.sh

Use Case 4: Find Log Files Growing Rapidly
find /var/log -type f -size +500M


Investigate:

tail -f /var/log/messages

Use Case 5: Find all open ports & config files
ss -tulnp
find /etc -name "*.conf"

🔴 6. BONUS: Useful Shortcuts for RHCSA
Task	Command
Find 10 largest files	               `find / -type f -exec du -sh {} +
Find hidden files	                        find /home -name ".*"
Find empty directories	                    find / -type d -empty
Find files changed by user	                   find / -user admin -mtime -1
