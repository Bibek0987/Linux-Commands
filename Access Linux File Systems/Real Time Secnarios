1: A new disk is attached — You must partition, format, and mount it
Commands:
lsblk
fdisk /dev/sdc   # create /dev/sdc1
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1
mkdir /appdata
mount /dev/sdc1 /appdata
echo "/dev/sdc1 /appdata xfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

Why this is real?

This happens during adding storage for applications, logs, backup, database, or Docker/OCP storage.

🟦 SCENARIO 2: Developer complains “disk is full”
Check disks:
df -h
du -sh /var/log/*

Found /data disk is not mounted (mount failed after reboot)
Fix:
mount -a


If error → check fstab syntax.

🟨 SCENARIO 3: NFS Share needs to be mounted for application
Test NFS:
showmount -e 10.0.0.20

Mount:
mount -t nfs 10.0.0.20:/sapdata /mnt/sap

Permanent:
10.0.0.20:/sapdata  /mnt/sap  nfs  defaults  0 0

🟥 SCENARIO 4: "device is busy" when trying to unmount
Issue:
umount /data
umount: /data: target is busy.

Solution: find who is using it
lsof | grep /data
fuser -m /data


Kill processes:

fuser -km /data
umount /data

🟧 SCENARIO 5: ISO file needs to be mounted
mount -o loop RHEL9.iso /mnt/iso


Unmount:

umount /mnt/iso

----------------------------
🔧 4. COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
----------------------------
❌ Error: "mount: wrong fs type"

Fix:

blkid /dev/sdb1
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1

❌ Error: "mount: special device does not exist"

Fix:

lsblk
fdisk -l
udevadm settle

❌ Error: machine stuck during boot because fstab entry is wrong

Fix by editing fstab in rescue mode:

mount -o remount,rw /
vim /etc/fstab


Add noauto temporarily or comment the broken line.

❌ Error: "target is busy"

Fix:

lsof /data
fuser -km /data
umount /data

🧠 5. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (with Answers)
----------------------------
1. What is mounting in Linux?

Mounting means attaching a filesystem to a directory so the OS can access it.

2. What file is used for permanent mounting?
/etc/fstab

3. How to check which process is preventing unmount?
fuser -m /mountpoint
lsof /mountpoint

4. Difference between mount and unmount?

mount → add filesystem

umount → remove filesystem

5. How to mount ISO?
mount -o loop file.iso /mnt

6. What happens if fstab has a wrong entry?

The system may not boot.

7. How to mount NFS?
mount -t nfs server:/path /mnt

8. How to remount root filesystem read-write?
mount -o remount,rw /

----------------------------
🏢 6. REAL COMPANY SCENARIOS (Very Common)
----------------------------
⭐ Scenario A — Application server needs a separate /app mount

Company wants separate storage for application logs.

Solution:
fdisk /dev/sdb
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
mkdir /app
mount /dev/sdb1 /app
echo "/dev/sdb1 /app xfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

⭐ Scenario B — Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) needs separate storage

DB team asks for separate mount for /var/lib/mysql.

Steps:

Stop DB

Mount new disk

Copy old data

Update fstab

⭐ Scenario C — Kubernetes/OpenShift storage

Storage team provides new disk for container logs.

Mount under:

/var/lib/containers
/var/lib/kubelet


Requires:

mount /dev/sdc1 /var/lib/containers

⭐ Scenario D — Programmer accidentally deleted fstab entry

System fails to mount important disk → website down.

Fix:

mount -a
vim /etc/fstab

⭐ Scenario E — Backup team wants NFS mount

Mount backup storage:

mount -t nfs backupserver:/archive /mnt/backup


Add in fstab:

backupserver:/archive /mnt/backup  nfs  defaults 0 0
