SCENARIO 1: Web Application Not Loading (Permission Denied)

A company hosts a website on Apache/Nginx.
Application returns:

403 Forbidden
Permission denied: /var/www/html

Reason

The web server user (apache, nginx, www-data) doesn’t have permission.

Fix
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html

Why it happens

Developers deploy files, but ownership gets changed accidentally.

🟩 🔵 SCENARIO 2: Jenkins Cannot Execute Build Script

Jenkins job fails:

permission denied: ./build.sh

Reason

Script missing execute permission.

Fix
chmod +x build.sh

Real impact

Build pipeline stops → deployment blocked → production release delayed.

🟧 🔵 SCENARIO 3: Developer Needs Access Without Changing Owner

A developer from the AI team needs access to a file managed by the Linux admin team.
Ownership cannot be changed.

Solution using ACL
setfacl -m u:rahul:rw /data/report.csv

Why real companies use this

Multiple teams may need access → ACL gives fine-grained permission.

🟨 🔵 SCENARIO 4: Shared Team Folder Keeps Overwriting Group Ownership

Team folder /project/data/ is used by DevOps team.
New files created inside become owned by “root” group instead of “devops”.

Fix using SGID bit
chgrp -R devops /project/data
chmod 2775 /project/data

Meaning of 2 (SGID)

Files inside inherit the group.

Real reason

Prevents permission issues in shared environments.

🟥 🔵 SCENARIO 5: A User Cannot Delete Files in Shared Folder

Folder: /shared/logs/
Users get:

Operation not permitted

Reason: sticky bit missing
Fix
chmod +t /shared/logs

Where companies use sticky bit?

/tmp

Shared project folders

Jenkins workspace

🟪 🔵 SCENARIO 6: Application Logs Not Getting Created

App fails to write logs in /var/log/app/:

Error writing log file

Reason

Folder owned by root.

Fix
sudo chown -R appuser:appgroup /var/log/app
chmod -R 750 /var/log/app

In real companies

Logging issues break monitoring (Prometheus/ELK).

🟫 🔵 SCENARIO 7: Security Team Requires Sensitive File Protection

Company must store credentials/keys with restricted access.

Solution:
chmod 600 secrets.key
chown root:root secrets.key

Why?

Only root should read the file → standard security practice.

🟦 🔵 SCENARIO 8: File Has ‘immutable’ Attribute — Cannot Delete or Edit

Admin tries:

rm -f config.conf


Gets:

Operation not permitted

Reason

File attribute immutable.

Check
lsattr config.conf

Remove
chattr -i config.conf
rm config.conf

Real company example

Immutable protects important configs like /etc/resolv.conf.

🟩 🔵 SCENARIO 9: Database Backup Fails Due to Permission Issues

MySQL backup script writes to /backup/db/.

Error:

Permission denied: /backup/db

Fix
chown mysql:mysql /backup/db
chmod 700 /backup/db

Real impact

Backups failing → high risk.

🟧 🔵 SCENARIO 10: Docker Container Cannot Read Host Files

Container mounts:

/data:/app/data

Inside container:

permission denied

Reason

Host directory not owned properly.

Fix
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /data
chmod 755 /data

Real-world usage

Containers run as non-root → need correct UID/GID mapping.

🔵 COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (REAL COMPANY INTERVIEWS)
1️⃣ How do you give permission to only the owner?
chmod 700 folder

2️⃣ What is sticky bit?

Only the owner can delete files in a shared folder.

Set:

chmod +t /shared

3️⃣ What is the difference between 644, 755, and 775?

644 → owner read+write, others read

755 → owner rwx, others r-x (common for web apps)

775 → owner & group rwx, others r-x

4️⃣ What is ACL and why is it needed?

ACL = fine-grained permission system.
Used when multiple users need different access.

5️⃣ How do you check all permissions (including ACL & attributes)?
ls -l
getfacl file
lsattr file

6️⃣ How do you give multiple users access to a directory?
setfacl -m u:alice:rwx -m u:bob:rw /data

7️⃣ How do you protect critical configuration files?
chattr +i /etc/ssh/sshd_config

8️⃣ What is the SGID bit?

Ensures all files inherit group ownership.
