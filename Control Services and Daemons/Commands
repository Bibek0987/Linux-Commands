 Part 1: Basic Commands to Control Services & Daemons (with simple explanation)

Linux uses systemd to manage services.
The command used is systemctl.

✔ Start a service
sudo systemctl start httpd


Starts the service right now (Apache example).

✔ Stop a service
sudo systemctl stop httpd


Stops the service immediately.

✔ Restart a service
sudo systemctl restart httpd

###  Used when configuration changes are applied. ####

✔ Reload service (without stopping)
sudo systemctl reload httpd


Reloads config without downtime (if service supports it).

✔ Enable service on boot
sudo systemctl enable httpd


Service automatically starts after reboot.

✔ Disable service
sudo systemctl disable httpd


Service won’t start after reboot.

✔ Check service status
systemctl status httpd


Shows logs, active/inactive state, PID, etc.

✔ View service logs (via journald)
journalctl -u httpd


View logs for a specific service.

✔ View last 100 lines
journalctl -u httpd -n 100

✔ Follow real-time logs
journalctl -u httpd -f

##::-->>> Part 2: Real-Time Company Scenarios + Commands <<<-----::##
🔹 Scenario 1: Website is not loading

Check Apache/Nginx service:

systemctl status httpd


If inactive:

systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

🔹 Scenario 2: Application service crashed unexpectedly

Check logs:

journalctl -u myapp.service -n 50


Restart:

systemctl restart myapp

🔹 Scenario 3: Service fails on boot

Check enabled services:

systemctl is-enabled mysqld


Fix by enabling:

systemctl enable mysqld

🔹 Scenario 4: Port is not listening

Check if service is running:

ss -tulnp | grep 80


If no output → service not running → restart service.

🔹 Scenario 5: Configuration change not applied

Reload service:

systemctl reload nginx


If reload is not supported → use restart.

🔹 Scenario 6: High CPU usage from a service

Find the service:

top


Then restart:

systemctl restart tomcat


Check logs:

journalctl -u tomcat

##::-->>> Part 3: Common Issues & Solutions (with commands) <<<-----::##
❗ Issue 1: Service fails to start

Check the reason:

systemctl status docker
journalctl -u docker -n 50


Fix missing directory or config, then restart:

systemctl restart docker

❗ Issue 2: “Unit not found”

Means service file is missing.

Check the directory:

ls /usr/lib/systemd/system/
ls /etc/systemd/system/


Reload daemon:

systemctl daemon-reload

❗ Issue 3: Service stuck in failed state

Reset it:

systemctl reset-failed nginx
systemctl start nginx

❗ Issue 4: Service not enabled after reboot

Fix:

systemctl enable crond

❗ Issue 5: Permission denied

Check permissions:

ls -l /usr/bin/myapp
chmod +x /usr/bin/myapp


Restart:

systemctl restart myapp
