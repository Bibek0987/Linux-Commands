1. IMPORTANT LINUX PROCESS MONITORING COMMANDS (with explanation)
1️⃣ ps – View running processes

Shows running processes for the current user/session.

Examples:
ps


→ Basic process list.

ps aux


→ Show all processes from all users.

ps aux | grep nginx


→ Check if nginx is running.

2️⃣ top – Real-time process monitoring

Displays live CPU, memory, load, tasks.

top

Useful inside top:

k → kill a process

h → help

q → quit

M → sort by memory

P → sort by CPU

3️⃣ htop – Advanced version of top

(Only if installed)

Install:

sudo yum install htop -y   # RHEL/CentOS
sudo apt install htop -y   # Ubuntu


Run:

htop


Colorful + easy filtering.

4️⃣ kill – Terminate a process
kill <PID>


Example:

kill 1234


Force kill:

kill -9 1234

5️⃣ pgrep – Find process ID by name
pgrep sshd

6️⃣ pkill – Kill by process name
pkill httpd

7️⃣ nice – Set priority while starting a process

Lower value = higher priority.

nice -n 10 myscript.sh

8️⃣ renice – Change priority of an existing process
renice 5 -p 1234

9️⃣ systemctl – Manage system services

Start:

sudo systemctl start httpd


Enable at boot:

sudo systemctl enable httpd


Check status:

systemctl status httpd

🔟 vmstat, iostat, sar – Advanced monitoring tools
vmstat
vmstat 2 5


→ Shows memory, CPU, and process stats every 2 sec (5 times).

iostat
iostat -x 2


→ Disk I/O monitoring.

sar
sar -u 2 5


→ CPU usage history.

🟣 2. REAL-TIME COMPANY SCENARIOS + COMMANDS + SOLUTIONS
🧵 Scenario 1: Server is slow, CPU usage is 100%
Check which process is consuming CPU:
top -o %CPU

Identify culprit:
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head

Solution:

Kill or restart the process:

kill -9 <pid>


Or restart service:

systemctl restart tomcat

🧵 Scenario 2: Memory leak issue
Check memory usage:
free -h

List processes using high memory:
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head

Check which app is leaking:
top -o %MEM


👉 Fix: Restart the service, investigate logs.

🧵 Scenario 3: Disk I/O high due to a heavy process
Find I/O heavy processes:
iotop


or:

ps aux --sort=-%io

Solution:

Throttle or stop the process.

🧵 Scenario 4: Zombie processes found
Find zombie processes:
ps aux | grep Z

Solution:

Restart parent process:

systemctl restart <service>

🧵 Scenario 5: Web server down (httpd/nginx)
Check if process is running:
systemctl status httpd

Start service:
sudo systemctl start httpd

Check port:
ss -tulnp | grep :80

🧵 Scenario 6: High load average but CPU is idle
Check load:
uptime

Check disk I/O bottleneck:
iostat -x 2


Fix: Disk performance tuning, stop heavy cron job.

🔴 3. COMMON ISSUES + SOLUTIONS (with commands)
❗ Issue 1: Process stuck in uninterruptible sleep (D)

Cause: Disk I/O, NFS hang, slow storage.

Solution:

Restart the service or unmount the stuck filesystem:

umount -f /mnt/nfs

❗ Issue 2: Process won't die even after kill -9

Cause: Kernel wait state.

Solution:
Fix storage / disk/NFS issue.

❗ Issue 3: Service failing on boot

Check logs:

journalctl -u docker


Fix config error → restart.

❗ Issue 4: Too many open files (ulimit issue)

Error:

Too many open files


Fix:

ulimit -n 65535


Permanent fix: edit /etc/security/limits.conf.
